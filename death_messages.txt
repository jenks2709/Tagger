RIP in pieces.
I hardly knew 'em.
They died as they lived.
F.
help, im ded.
Goodnight sweet prince.
I can't say I'm surprised.
That's not very social distancing of you.
If your grave doesn't say 'rest in peace' on it you are automatically drafted into the skeleton war.
 A body has been discovered!,
They'll be back.
So long gay bowser!
They needed a smaller gun.
It's probably for the best.
You're not yourself when you're hungry. Go eat a human.
They did the maths but boy do they suck at maths
They felt the full palm touch.
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
 Who saw that one coming?,
I'm surprised that they lasted this long., 
They should have gone to specsavers., 
GG humans have lost.
I call hax.,
Every little helps.
I'm loving it.
They got in the way of the fifty yard zombie dash.
Guten tagged.
How the hell does a sock jam?
Parry this you fucking casuals.
The Badspeed has been deployed
You spanner!
They were in your walls
Have you tried turning it off and on again?
Better luck next time

I used to be a zombie like you, then I took a dart to the knee
You should have ran faster
